# Trash Robot

a concept for a self-replicating free robot: Arduino, COTS parts, trash feed, physical media outputs, practical machines, how to scale to other parts of the Technological Complete Set, block diagram of a Zero Extraction Manufacturing trash robot, sketch of how trash robot can be used to build out further ZEM technology A sketch of the trash plotter concept: carving stone to make markers for trash economics, self replicating trash robots as basis for evolving technology toward a technological complete set.

## The plotter

The plotter is a abstract way of building machines that can be programmed with geometron. 

The geometron plotter language, building it up, how to structure it

the geometron web language, building plotter programs

how to build the simple plotter with COTS parts

## stone tablets

how to make stone tablet manufacturing robot

power of the stone tablet for replacing money, how it can work in post capitalist economics

long term data storage, history and future.  

Roctal encoding as a possible system for encoding, the fractal, self-documentation.

## Futher applications of the trash plotter

lab on chip, microfluidics.  generic manipulator.  vibration, heat, grinding, cutting, photolithography, scanning ion tool in fluid, electrochemical fabrication in a ionic fluid.

## Block diagram of the ZEM plotter

What is ZEM, Zero Extraction Manufacturing.

the web server is upcycled phones, as is the arduino.  upcycled optical stage, wire from old transformers make coils for vibrational drive, flow of cell phone hardware and old broken computers makes a ionic plotter which can edit hardware and add more and more closed loop processes.  Ultimately when we have the ability to integrate any hardware with any other hardware using full ionic fabrication.  When we can use ZEM to make technology that can create data that can last 10,000 years and can use it to make more copies of itself, and so on, we have a fully self replicating technological core which can for the basis of a very stable set of technology, any set of technology.
