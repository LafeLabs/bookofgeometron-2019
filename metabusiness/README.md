# Meta Business


In order to be self-sustaining, a full copy of the information contained here must be able to be used to generate revenue for a team that has learned it.  What are some ways this will happen?

- build local web content for local business which links to the global web, as service for local businesses, barter-based, build flows of commerce in exchange for free stuff from the local businesses 
- build useful web apps, calculators etc and make money on ads on those pages
- make and sell books
- make and sell cardboard box art
- make and sell skeletron furniture artifacts
- make and sell trash robot plotters
- create a custom brand language and deploy it on the internet
- teaching web code as service
- selling geometron painted keyboards
- make and sell custom painted artifacts which act as markers, markers as art
- carved or otherwise processed artifacts made with trash plotter--trash plotter as factory of marketable goods
 

The business model based on self-replicating technology where transmitting the technology is a service people pay for while learning how to also transmit it.  Thus money flows through the system as it exponentially expands.  The system can be thought as a living system that grows, where money always flows in from the edges.  

In the beginning when full topological economics has not been developed, everyone in the network will be trying to survive, trying to make money, so we will all be interfacing with those who are new to the network, trying to expand with as steep an exponential as possible.  This can be *very* fast and can generate a *lot* of money just by the nature of the scaling, as with existing Internet-scaled business. As the system expands and there are fewer people who have not seen this to spread it to, the power of topological economics inside the system will grow, and those deeper in the base branches of the tree will increasingly be able to rely on the new system for survival.  This will involve both increasing the number of networked people and the number of networked self-replicating technological things.
