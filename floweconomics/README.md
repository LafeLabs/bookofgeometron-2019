# Flow Economics

Capitalism tends to consume other systems because it increases entropy, creates more information flow and structure than is possible with a centralized economy.  The system that will in turn consume capitalism will add further entropy by creating further complexity.  This happens by creating media which carries information along with in which how it flows from one node to another in the network is fundamental to the nature of that thing.  The potential number of flows of thing along paths from one node to another vastly exceeds the number of possible things. And both of these vastly exceed the complexity of reducing all things to numbers.  Increased complexity, increased entropy, this is the system which can consume its predecessor.  

How does this work?  Things in the Universe of Things already described here flow around from person to person. This in a very literal physical sense is what replaces money.  Money is just a number.  Things flowing from one person to another vastly increase the number of degrees of freedom.  

Decks of cards, where cards represent actions and other things can be carried by everyone, and exchanged. Exchanges lead to replication of things, some of which are actions. Cards are constantly replicated, but can also be exchanged for physical things or actions. Copying of cards and exchange live in parallel.  Unlike money which can only be created by central banks or governments or mines, thing cards can be created from nothing, and can constantly replicate and expand exponentially.  If money expands exponentially and is copied without central control it leads to "inflation", in which the effective value of the currency drops.  This is not true of thing cards.  They are flow of information in a network, and like all networked structures, the larger the network grows the more valuable each element of it is.  A pile of cards on the floor of my room today have zero value.  One action card to barter for some food in a huge network of people who all participate in the system can give you a meal for just a card with the right symbols on it--just knowing enough to copy that card with those symbols will be enough to live on in a huge powerful network of participants who do all the things needed to create a functioning society.
