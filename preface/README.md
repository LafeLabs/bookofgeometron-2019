# Preface

This is a teaching action book.  Each chapter or section has actions, for both a teacher and a student.  If a teacher leads a student through the whole book carefully the student should then after a little practice be prepared to act as the teacher when teaching another person as the student and so on.  This is a labor intensive process for both parties, and it will in many cases make sense for the time of the teacher to be compensated by the student as a "pay it forward" system, where the student then becomes the teacher and teachers others to use the system for payment.  

In general, we want the products of this knowledge to have intrinsic value on top of knowledge for its own sake. That is, learning and using this knowledge leads to the ability to both produce value to the people around you without money but also real economic benefit that can be turned into cash flow to survive in our current economic system.

So in general each section will have a "teacher action" and "student action".  In the beginning of the book student actions will be very simple, and will get increasingly complex through the course of the book.  By the end, the student is able to edit and copy every part of the system, and should in principle not need the teacher to propagate the system.
