# Skeletron

Another organic media element is skeletron, a way of building three dimensional structures using geometry, sticks, and string or rope.  Each stick is organic media: you can put urls on it

Skeletron is a system of finding and modifying found objects in such a way that they can be combined together to build three dimensional geometric structures.  These structures can be used for many things: furniture, shelters, industrial infrastructure for fabrication, boats, docks and other floating structures, back pack frames, extensions of bicycles to carry gear, or purely decorative art pieces.  The look of Skeletron is distinctive enough that its presence can immediately signify to someone in the know of the existence of Geoemetron infrastructure.  

So that's what it does and why we care but what exactly is it, and how do we make it?  The main structural elements are first made by finding "stick-like" things, including wood sticks, metal poles, long thing boards, long plastic pieces, and other long thin objects.  Each element has a hole drilled in each end just back from the end, generally as close as possible to the end.  In some cases this can be a notch instead of a hole.  The other feedstock material for Skeletron is some kind of string, rope, wire, or other tying element that can be threaded through the holes in the ends of the structural elements.
