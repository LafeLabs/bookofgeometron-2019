# Pages

The fundamental element of digital organic media is the self-replicating web page.  Going back to our definition of organic media, we note that this means the *whole* thing must replicate.  Not just some web content, but the software it runs on, the server, the domain registration, a person to maintain it, etc.--all this must be replicated for this to be organic media.  

The first thing that distinguishes the organic pages of our networks from normal web pages is their self-editing properties.  All pages have an "edit" button, which looks like this:

![](iconsymbols/editor.svg)

If you click on this icon on any page, you're on the editor.  Just edit the text and click the edit button again, and there's your web page.  The language of the Web is HTML, or the HyperText Markup Language.  This involves various "tags" made from angle brackets that look like this:

<pre>
&ltp&gt
A paragraph goes inside "p" tags.  &ltb&gtBold faced&lt/b&gt text goes in a "b" tag.
&lt/p&gt
</pre>

In order to get fully self-replicating web pages, we are faced with two choices: teach enough people html to get truly universal html literacy or use some simplified system of web publishing that does not require html.  Obviously, all the successful systems of self-publishing on the web have taken the later tack, from Wordpress to Facebook.  Indeed, much of the rise of large scale social media in the last 20 years is precisely this process: making web publishing possible for non experts.  The language used in this editor is called Markdown, and has some little bits and pieces of simple code that are a compromise: some learning of very simple code is required, but what we get for that is extreme simplicity of the code.   One of the projects people will hopefully take up in the evolution of this code is replacing the markdown with a system that
