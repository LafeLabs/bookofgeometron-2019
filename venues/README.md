In order to replicate all this organic media we need places to exist, to work, and to share.  This can take many forms, depending on how we are spreading the media.  Is this a business to make money from consulting with corporate clients?  Are we helping elderly people who are homebound to build new types of media to connect better?  Or are we mapping out a local shopping center to increase commerce to all there?
