# Replication and Repositories

All pages, maps and other types of web media in our system replicate using a script called replicator.php.  Php is a language from the ancient days of the early Web, which used to stand for "Personal Home Page" and now stands for "Php Hypertext Processor".  The php programming language, in general, runs on all web servers, including free ones and ones that you set up yourself.  It's truly universal, and requires no complex computer nonsense to run.  Just copy the file to the server, point a browser at it and it runs.  replicator.php calls a file called dna.txt which lists all the files to be copied. 

When you make a new sub-page as shown earlier in the page section, you use replicator to copy all the various files of the software which drives all web pages and maps in the various Geometron networks.
