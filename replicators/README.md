# Replication and Repositories

All pages, maps and other types of web media in our system replicate using a script called replicator.php.  Php is a language from the ancient days of the early Web, which used to stand for "Personal Home Page" and now stands for "Php Hypertext Processor".  The php programming language, in general, runs on all web servers, including free ones and ones that you set up yourself.  It's truly universal, and requires no complex computer nonsense to run.  Just copy the file to the server, point a browser at it and it runs.  replicator.php calls a file called dna.txt which lists all the files to be copied. 

When you make a new sub-page as shown earlier in the page section, you use replicator to copy all the various files of the software which drives all web pages and maps in the various Geometron networks.

There are also physical repositories, protected locations with containers where physical factory materials are stored in the world.  These can be cloned, as demonstrated by the Little Free Library.

## Teacher Action:

Prepare to show student exactly what they need to get walked through the process of making a github thing.  Learn what systems your student uses so you know the specific software for that.  guide student through creating a free github account, using it and navigating it. 

Make a repository of some simple thing like sticks or rocks on a Street or Watershed network, with a marker, map, and card. 

## Student action:

Get a free github account, install a github gui like github desktop, create a new page/thing, share it on github.

Clone a physical repository by using the supplies in the existing one to copy the whole thing to another location, ready to also be copied again etc.  This could just be painted rocks or painted sticks, a repository of a marker factory.
