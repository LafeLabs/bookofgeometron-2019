# Path, ὁδός, 道


The Path, or the Way, is a fundamental element of any cosmology.  It links this to numerous existing philosophical and religious frameworks, in which the basic shared belief system of a group of people is defined by what we *do*, how we *live*, the path we walk as we go through life.  

This may seem trivial, and it's generally ignored in modern science, but this is one of the things that makes our current system of science so broken.  In the scientific world view a cosmological theory just stands alone as a sterile collection of mathematical relations, independent of the people who made the theory, who use it, or whose lives might be affected by it.  Indeed the theory is generally not even judged on who can understand or interact with it.  Theories have something called "truth", and if we believe the truth is greater than other theories, that is more important than how many people can understand it or what benefit there is for those who do understand it.  

The Path we walk will be how we come together as people to live in a shared Universe in a Watershed, connected to Streets, and building useful things in Factories.  The word "way" references the word used in numerous Asian languages which is spelled "dao" in Mandarin, or "do" in Japanese and Korean.  The word "Path" was used by the early Christians to describe their fellowship, and so this combined idea of path/way has strong resonances both in the Christian world and in the East.  Also, "Path" implies a linking of points in a space, which is a useful way of thinking of a way of life.  Life can be thought of as a sequence of actions we take as we traverse through space and time.  This sequence forms a path in the Universe of potential actions.

There are numerous Paths which will be constructed by those who read this book and its offshoots. Rather than dwell too much on specifics, this section merely describes how important this is as a concept and lets the reader imagine, describe and share their own vision.  This might be religious or secular, vague or specific, strict or liberal, but what matters is that we think about it and then declare and share it.  Only be declaring a path, sharing it, and propagating it, can we create the rapid evolution required to make *better* paths.  I do not claim to have the best path or even be anywhere near a best path. I merely want to convince the reader that *a* path is worthwhile.  

One way or another, it is the path, or the fundamental way of life that we have to change if we will survive as a species. This has to go together with building a new cosmology but is not really the same thing: a cosmology defines how we see our world, and the path defines how we live in that world.  In today's world our paths are largely unexamined
and divorced from our mechanistic cosmologies that are so abstract as to have little impact on our day to day lives.  Many people in modern society therefore turn to ancient cosmologies, various old religious beliefs, and strive to follow a path of living that is in line with that cosmology.  This has a tendency to be very superficial, however, as using an ancient cosmology in a modern society means having a cosmology that has very little to say about much of the structure of technological society which simply did not exist when their world views were being formed.  People who walk this path cling to very specific pet issues, but keep driving cars to work at pointless jobs, and buying the same consumer products as everyone else.  They keep supporting governments and companies that pursue policies that are leading us all to extinction.  

If we want to get off these paths, we must create cosmologies that reflect realities of the modern world, and then rebuild our whole ways of living up inside those cosmologies and modify both as we go based on what works or what does not work.  This is what the ancient people did to build the older world views people still cling to and it is what we must do now.

## Teacher Action:

Present and describe how you live the Path of Geometron, how it fits into your life.  Learn from your students what their paths are now: what do they believe, how do they lives their lives, how do they want to make that better, how do they want to live?

## Student Action:

Listen, learn and discuss how Geometron might fit into your life in ways that might alter its path.  Articulate your path: what do you believe, how does that impact how you live? how might you change how you live to be more in line with a geometron cosmology?
