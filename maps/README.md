# Maps/Memes


We define a "map" or "meme" as a structure of images and text stacked on top of each other, with specified relative position, scale and orientation.  If we take a broad view of this format, it is one of the most powerful forms of media in existence today.  This includes all PowerPoint slides and other types of business presentation, most advertisements, magazine covers, and memes.  In many ways PowerPoint slides are *the* media that drives our society, as most new actions taken in both government and the private sector are initiated based on pitches in this format.  Advertisements which are essentially in this meme format completely drive the economics of the World Wide Web, and are the life blood without which the commercial Internet simply would not exist.  Memes drive our politics and culture, and wars of memes end up completely defining peoples world views now.  I also use the term "map" as a general term for this format, which also has each element be potentially a hyperlink to some other map or page or part of the Web.

A slide deck like a powerpoint deck can be created by linking a sequence of maps with hyperlinks, althogh this has much greater versatility and power than the powerpoint format.
