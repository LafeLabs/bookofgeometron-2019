# Teams

Teams have roles, people take on what roles they want or can or are good at.  Roles can incorporate fantasy and ritual to build out a new way of life which is an adventure and is easy to understand.  Roles might have special costumes, hats, things one carries with one at all times.  A person who gets totally immersed in their role can have a very deep knowledge over time, much deeper than would be possible without building specialization into teams.  These roles are as much social as technical: a water scout especially will be someone who knows the local Watershed backwards and forwards, keeps track of its ups and downs, helps build its network, helps guide everyone else around it, and keeps in touch with other water scouts in other teams, so ultimately there can be a *global* water scout network.  This can also be true of the totally technical specializations like the builders of local web servers, which form a sort of professional guild, connecting to each other via the Street network and helping each other to build out that layer of the network as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Teams and guilds built out of roles in teams on a global level allow us to have the same kind of network effect that for profit social networks have now: the whole will be *much* greater than the sum of the parts.
