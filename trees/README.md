# The Universe of Things

The Internet of Things has today been taken to mean the network of consumer products which should not have computers in them all being equipped with web servers.  The networks described in this work are something different: a Universe of Things. Each "thing" maps to a page or map, and things are things in the most general and abstract sense.  A thing might be "the paint chip 2 inches from the top most bolt on the left side of the bench in the park on the north side of the fountain".  Or "the weird feeling of sadness one feels when looking at the same paint chip", or "the text editor used to write a poem about that feeling".  Things are truly maximally general in our world view, and a thing simply maps to some unique URL, of which there can easily be many 10's of thousands on even a tiny domain hosted on a very minimal web page.

Things are, in general, fractal.  That is, things are composed of sub-things.  On the web, this means things which have some unique URL that points to someplace on the file system of the web server have sub directories which map to things that are considered to be conceptual subsets in some way of the thing at the higher level url.  

A collection of sub-things below a thing, and all the sub-sub things below that can be called a "tree", as it is a structure with one root and branches that fork and fork again, and eventually bear fruit. Trees can replicate.  This works.  But it is awkward.  It will work much better after it evolves.

See a tree, replicate a tree. example of a thing.
