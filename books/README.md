# Books

Books are things.  Books are media.  Structure of this book, how it is built, links to pdfs. The people's printer.  printing in zine format from pdf with printer settings. Hand binding of booklets.  Printing a pdf and hand sewing binding.  Printing the Books of GEometron and binding them all the combining them in a single hard bound volume with cardboard and duct tape, and symbolic shapes on the cover.

## The people's printer

The people's printer is a way of getting things printed for free by interacting with passerby in an area with a lot of offices.  Someone who is good at getting peoples attention and provides some form of value to passerby.  We have a pdf document on a web address, and put the web address on a piece of physical media.  This should not be a long hard to read url, but a top level address that's easy to type or remember, and links to how to navigate down through the tree network to a node with the pdf, then a symbol or simple name that tells the user how to get that pdf.  

As people pass by and engage with the Geometron Camp, they'll take physical media with them, go to their offices, and navigate to the pdf, print it according to instructions found on the linked page, and bring the printouts back to the camp.  This unbound print out can be traded for other goods or services at the camp, but a very logical trade is to get a bound book in return.  People can thus bring a constant flow of unbound freely(stolen from random offices) printed books to the camp and walk away with bound books, while constantly growing the system by printing more than one copy at a time.

In order to make printouts that can become books, we need to study how printer software works, and how to turn normal full page format into book format, rotated by 90 degrees, and divided into two pages per page-side, with the proper page numbering etc. 

## The self replicating bound book

In order for a full book factory to exist, we need the tools to build more than just stacks of paper with stolen printouts. We need the ability to bind books that actually feel like books.  In order to do this, we need a needle, thread, and a thumb tack to poke holes in the pages.  We also need a ruler to mark even spacing of the holes.  This is enough to make "zine" formatted books, but more is needed to make a full sized book.  Duct tape and cardboard and tools to work the cardboard, along with art supplies to decorate the cover is enough to make a nicely bound book.  


## Teacher Action

build a book factory kit with sewing kit etc.  

Print out a copy, unbound, of Books of Geometron.

create a fully bound copy of book of Geometron 

make your own book to share, a blank book with your art to give to student, pass along the one you got as a student to your student, if a bunch have collected, bind them and deposit them in a book depository


## Student Action:

bind a blank book

print and bind Books of Geometron

## Business action
