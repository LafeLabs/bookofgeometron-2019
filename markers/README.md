# Physical Markers

The networks described here all have physical levels intrinsic to their structure, intertwined with the digital layers. Their primary role in the network is as pointers: links which direct people to their online instances.  The most basic media element is thus just a object with a web address written on it.  To make this self replicating all that is needed is to include a paint men or similar marking tool with it, which can be used to make more markers(we use the term "marker" to refer to this simple pointer to a web page).

Common forms for markers can be a stick with bark shaved off and a flat side carved with a knife, written on with a paint pen, then tied to something in a strategic location.  Or it might be  a bit of trash like a piece of cardboard(back to the cardboard sign from an earlier example, as a prototype organic media element).  When the form of a marker is more sign-like, as with the bigger pieces of flat cardboard, it makes sense to add more information.  This is a chance to add various sub-pages, not just a basic address.  For instance we might place a strategic sign somewhere along a local watershed element like the underside of a bridge, with information on the main watershed domain as well as various sub pages that direct people to the bridge, some history of that spot, and maybe directions for a repository of materials under the bridge shared by people in that watershed, or a factory run from that location.  

In addition to the basic markers which just point to a place in a geographic element which is part of a Watershed or Street network, there are physical media elements which point to parts of Factories.  These are Action Cards.  Action cards are a system of exchange which are similar to how money functions in existing economics but carry more information.  

A 10 dollar bill in existing economic systems is identical to 10 one dollar bills.  It's just numbers, and only the total matters.  Action cards, however, denote actions, actual physical things one does in the process of some Factory operation.  A collection of cards is a deck, which should bring to mind both the phrase "deck of cards" and also "slide deck" as is commonly used in business today.  

A typical action card might be something like "Harvest Cardboard, deliver to Factory camp".  This might have a cartoon of a cardboard box and a box cutter, a url for a local factory repository location in a Watershed or Street network location, and a url for a digital file describing how to harvest cardboard, with photographs and tips for getting the right kind of cardboard for some task.  This might go along with a card for cutting the cardboard to the right size for building something useful, a card for how it fits into some useful thing, a card for who to contact to pass along the processed cardboard etc.  Altogether these cards form a deck which has an online image mapping all cards to various pages, all of which self-replicate. 

Cards can be ornate works of art, much like tarot cards, or can be very crude sets of instructions on index cards or bits of paper trash written with a pen.  All that is needed to replicate them is very basic art supplies including paper media, and the means to replicate the online images, mentioned in the previous section.

To build fully self-replicating systems of physical media we need something we call the ArtBox: a self relicating art supply carrier.  In its very crudest form this might be a found box with some found pens and paper trash one carries around.  However, as we develop more and more sophisticated elements of physical organic media, this should evolve into something of real intrinsic value.  In general, what the ArtBox is is a geometric box made up of cardboard, packing tape, and duct tape, which holds art supplies, along with a similar box made to hold cards.  The art supply box is meant to hold a box cutter, templates, sharpies, crayons, pens, and other art supplies needed to replicate itself.  It is carried by adding a shoulder strap like a purse, which also is where the rolls of tape are carried(threaded around the strap) that are needed to make another one.  The various sides to the ArtBox are also organic media, which contain links to digital media which document the system and the specific factory instance which generated that specific ArtBox.  ArtBox is also a beautiful and functional object which can be used as a general purpose purse and can be sold for money as a means to keep our Path as a financially productive process enabling us to survive and grow.  One of the first parts of the "meta business" described in this work is just to sit on the side of the street with a cardboard sign and sell ArtBoxes for money as well as to charge money for the service of guiding passerby to build their own ArtBoxes and learn how to pass it along to the next person.  This process of hands on combined art and technology education, to spread physical organic media to people is both a more faithful beginning of the world we want to build and also a more financially sustainable system than just selling the physical units.  One could easily charge over 100 dollars for a hands on experiential learning service, for under an hour of labor, with very minimal input of money for materials, for hours a day, with multiple people, generating thousands of dollars for a single Trash Camp(to be described later in this work.)
  

## Teacher Action:

Place markers out in the environment for both Street ant Watershed networks, collect and organize the art supplies needed to make new markers and bring them with you.

## Student Action:

With art supplies provided, add a new marker to the environment for either a new or existing node on one of the networks.
